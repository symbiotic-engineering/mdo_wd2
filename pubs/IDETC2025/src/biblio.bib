abstract   = {A key component of wave energy converters (WECs), which determines the technical and economic performance of WECs, is the power takeoff (PTO) system. This WEC subsystem converts the hydrodynamic excitation of the WEC into useful mechanical and, typically, electrical energy. It is well known that WEC control systems have the capability to significantly enhance the performance of WECs, but are limited in scope by the physical PTO displacement and force constraints. A variety of WEC control algorithms have the capacity to include the PTO constraints within the (constrained) optimal control formulation, delivering performance which takes maximum advantage of the available operational space, but avoiding exceedance of device/PTO specifications. However, little consideration is given to the interplay between the constraint levels and the maximum achievable performance. This paper examines, from an economic perspective, the trade-off between energy receipts and the capital cost of force and displacement constraints in a typical heaving point absorber WEC.},

However, for a number of reasons, the promised benefits from better control designs have yet to be widely realized by wave energy devices and wave energy remains a relatively nascent technology. This brief paper summarizes a simple, yet powerful approach to wave energy dynamics modeling, and subsequent control design based on impedance matching. Our approach leverages the same concepts that are exploited by a simple FM radio to achieve a feedback controller for wave energy devices that approaches optimal power absorption. If fully utilized, this approach can deliver immediate and consequential reductions to the cost of wave energy. Additionally, this approach provides the necessary framework for control co-design of a wave energy converter, in which an understanding of the control logic allows for synchronous design of the device control system and hardware.},

Therefore, EMD and non-equilibrium molecular simulation (NEMD) methods have been compared in calculating thermal conductivity. The results show that NEMD is better than EMD but the process is complicated. The structural properties are also discussed in this part.

  abstract   = {Improved power takeoff (PTO) controller design for wave energy converters is considered a critical component for reducing the cost of energy production. However, the device and control design process often remains sequential, with the space of possible final designs largely reduced before the controller has been considered. Control co-design, whereby the device and control design are considered concurrently, has resulted in improved designs in many industries, but remains rare in the wave energy community. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a new open-source code, WecOptTool, for control co-design of wave energy converters, with the aim to make the co-design approach more accessible and accelerate its adoption. Additionally, we highlight the importance of designing a wave energy converter to maximize electrical power, rather than mechanical power, and demonstrate the co-design process while modeling the PTO's components (i.e., drive-train and generator, and their dynamics). We also consider the design and optimization of causal fixed-structure controllers. The demonstration presented here considers the PTO design problem and finds the optimal PTO drive-train that maximizes annual electrical power production. The results show a 22% improvement in the optimal controller and drive-train co-design over the optimal controller for the nominal, as built, device design.},

abstract   = {A computational approach is developed to investigate wave interaction effects in sparse arrays of floating bodies (such as wave energy converters) based on linear potential theory. In particular, the wave diffraction and radiation problems in a multiple body array are solved in reasonable time and accuracy. In contrast to previous approaches that have considered all bodies in the array as a single module, the present approach treats each body in the array as an isolated body. The interactions resulting from the scattered wave field among the bodies are then taken into account via plane wave approximation in an iterative manner. The boundary value problem corresponding to an isolated body is solved by the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The approach is useful for wave periods in the range 4-15 s, provided that the bodies are separated by at least five times the characteristic dimension of a body. The main advantage of the approach is that the computational time and memory requirements are significantly less than that of conventional BEM. In this paper, first, the numerical results for hydrodynamic coefficients computed by the proposed approach are validated against conventional BEM. Next, the wave interaction effects on power production are investigated in arrays of 50 wave energy converters.},

The modelled plant consists of the Oyster wave energy converter, conventional reverse osmosis membranes and a pressure exchanger-intensifier for energy recovery. A time-domain model of the plant is produced using wavetank experimentation to calibrate the model of Oyster, manufacturer's data for the model of the reverse osmosis membranes and a hydraulic model of the pressure exchanger-intensifier. The economic model of the plant uses best-estimate cost data which are reduced to annualised costs to facilitate the calculation of the cost of water.

The controller acts on a throttle valve to regulate the pressure in the reverse osmosis unit in order to avoid damage to the membrane caused by excessive pressure and to improve both its longevity and the overall efficiency of the device. The control is constrained due to the rate and position limits of the throttle valve and the recovery ratio, which is the ratio between the total amount of pumped seawater and the potable water. The system is also switched and non-stationary because of the check valves used for the rectification of the seawater flow and the variation of the excitation force dynamic over time, respectively.

In this study, a wave-to-water numerical model was developed to investigate the potential use of a wave-powered desalination system (WPDS) for water production. The model was developed by coupling a time-domain radiation-and-diffraction method-based numerical tool (WEC-Sim) for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of WECs with a solution-diffusion model that was used to simulate the reverse-osmosis (RO) process. The objective of this research is to evaluate the WPDS dynamics and the overall efficiency of the system. To evaluate the feasibility of the WPDS, the wave-to-water numerical model was applied to simulate a desalination system that used an oscillating surge WEC device to pump seawater through the system. The hydrodynamics WEC-Sim simulation results for the oscillating surge WEC device were validated against existing experimental data. The RO simulation was verified by comparing the results to those from the Dow Chemical Company's reverse osmosis system analysis (ROSA) model, which has been widely used to design and simulate RO systems. The wave-to-water model was then used to analyze the WPDS under a range of wave conditions and for a two-WECs-coupled RO system to evaluate the influence of pressure and flow rate fluctuation on the WPDS performance. The results show that the instantaneous energy fluctuation from waves has a significant influence on the responding hydraulic pressure and flow rate, as well as the recovery ratio and, ultimately, the water-production quality. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce the hydraulic fluctuation for different sea states while maintaining a certain level of freshwater production, and a WEC array that produces water can be a viable, near-term solution to the nation's water supply. A discussion on the dynamic impact of hydraulic fluctuation on the WPDS performance and potential options to reduce the fluctuation and their trade-offs is also presented.},

In this study, a wave-to-water numerical model was developed to investigate the potential use of a wavepowered desalination system (WPDS) for water production in the United States. The model was developed by coupling a time-domain radiation-and-diffraction-method-based numerical tool (WEC-Sim) for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of WECs with a solution-diffusion model that was used to simulate the reverse-osmosis process. To evaluate the feasibility of the WPDS, the wave-to-water numerical model was applied to simulate a desalination system that used an oscillating surge WEC device to pump seawater through the system. The annual water production was estimated based on the wave resource at a reference site on the coast of northern California to investigate the potential cost of water in that area, where the cost of water and electricity is high compared to other regions. In the scenario evaluated, for a 100-unit utility-scale array, the estimated levelized cost of energy for these WECs is about 3-6 times the U.S.'s current, unsubsidized electricity rates. However, with clean water as an end product and by directly producing pressurized water with WECs, rather than electricity as an intermediary, it is presently only 12% greater than typical water cost in California. This study suggests that a WEC array that produces water may be a viable, near-term solution to the nation's water supply, and the niche application of the WPDS may also provide developers with new opportunities to further develop technologies that benefit both the electric and drinking water markets.},

abstract   = {One of the primary challenges for wave energy converter (WEC) systems is the fluctuating nature of wave resources, which require the WEC components to be designed to handle loads (i.e., torques, forces, and powers) that are many times greater than the average load. This approach requires a much greater power takeoff (PTO) capacity than the average power output and indicates a higher cost for the PTO. Moreover, additional design requirements, such as battery storage, are needed, particularly for practical electrical grid connection, and can be a problem for sensitive equipment (e.g., radar, computing devices, and sensors). Therefore, it is essential to investigate potential methodologies to reduce the overall power fluctuation while trying to optimize the power output from WECs. In this study, a detailed hydraulic PTO model was developed and coupled with a time-domain hydrodynamics model (WEC-Sim) to evaluate the PTO efficiency for WECs and the trade-off between power output and fluctuation using different power smoothing methods, including energy storage, pressure relief mechanism, and a powerbased setpoint control method. The study also revealed that the maximum power fluctuation for WECs can be significantly reduced by one order of magnitude when these power smoothing methods are applied.},

abstract   = {An array of ocean-wave energy converters, compared to a stand-alone device, provides lower energy-production costs but affects the aggregate power performance. Previous studies suggested that wave-interaction effects within the array could increase energy production by over 15% per device. However, no physical constraints on the WECs were considered in these studies; as a result, the devices can experience unrealistically large motions. A control strategy is thus desirable to coordinate individual WECs and maximize the energy extraction. We apply model-predictive control (MPC) to an array of point-absorber-type WECs by developing a formulation that accommodates hard constraints on the motion of each device and on the Power-takeoff (PTO) forces with excellent computational efficiency. Full multi-body wave-interaction effects are computed by a semianalytical method within linear-wave theory. This framework enables us to demonstrate results of realistic maximal power production for arrays of two, three, and four devices operating under constraints in sea waves of various incident angles. It is observed that wave-body interactions have actually destructive effects on the array power production for the majority cases in irregular sea waves. Also discussed are effects of the reactive power produced by the PTO unit and the possibility of removing it within the MPC framework.},

The parameters varied were: (i) average wind speed from 3.7 (system start-up) to 8.7 m/s; (ii) wind turbulence intensity from 0.0 (steady-state conditions) to 0.6 (extreme fluctuations); and (iii) period of oscillation from 15 to 90 s. With a feed water of 2750 mg/L NaCl, the wind-membrane system produced good-quality permeate (<600 mg/L) over the full range of wind speeds and fluctuations. The system performance (in terms of permeate flux and NaCl concentration) at average wind speeds of 7.0 m/s or more was unaffected by fluctuations up to a turbulence intensity of 0.4 and was independent of the period of fluctuation within this operating range. With a feed water of 5500 mg/L NaCl an average wind speed of 7.0 m/s or more was required to produce adequatequality permeate (<1000 mg/L) under fluctuating conditions.

abstract   = {The operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants is systematically optimized with the objective to reduce the electricity charges, which constitute the largest portion of the operation costs. Variable operating conditions and a time-of-use electricity tariff rate schedule are considered. A well-established model is extended to model a reverse osmosis (RO) system equipped with highly efficient pressure exchangers (PXs) and variable frequency drives (VFDs). All major performance factors are considered, including membrane's permeability, concentration polarization, temperature effects, membrane fouling, and efficiency dependency of the VFD on the loading conditions. The proposed formulation minimizes the electricity cost per day, given a desired daily production rate. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), allowing for periods without operation. The time domain (24 h) is discretized into 0.5 h increments, and a pseudo steady-state assumption is used. The optimal operation plan resulting in maximum electricity costsavings is established with standard global optimization tools. The results show significant electricity and production cost-saving potentials. More savings in electricity can be achieved by oversizing the plant, thus allowing shutting-off at periods of high electricity cost. The cost-saving potentials are particularly promising in electricity markets in which the electricity rate schedule is widely distributed.},

However, desalination uses significant amounts of energy, today mostly from fossil fuels. It is therefore favourable to rely on renewable energies, specifically the wind due to its low-cost and technological maturity, to power desalination systems. To prove the technical feasibility of wind-powered desalination with both reverse osmosis and mechanical vapour compression, physicsbased system models have been developed and the technical feasibility of using wind as the power source for desalination has been confirmed. The economics of wind-powered desalination are also favourable. The costs are in line with what is expected for a conventional desalination system, proving to be particularly cost-competitive in areas with good wind resources that have high costs of energy. It can be concluded that wind-powered desalination can be competitive with other desalination systems, providing safe and clean drinking water efficiently in an environmentally responsible manner.},

These variations are systematized within socalled operational strategies. Therefore, four different operational strategies are analysed in detail with regard to given restrictions e.g. by the membrane system. For each of these strategies the specific energy consumption over the total usable load range is computed with the simulated hydraulic characteristics of each operational strategy. The analysis of the gathered data shows that a membrane system should be operated with constant permeate recovery under fluctuating wind power. This operational strategy provides low specific energy consumption over a broad load range.},

To address this task, stub-filters, accumulators, and radially elastic-pipes are considered for smoothing the pressure fluctuations in the flow. An analytical model for fluidic capacitance of accumulators and elastic pipes are derived and verified. Commercially available accumulators in combination with essentially rigid (and low cost) piping are found to be a cost-effective solution for this application, and a model for selecting accumulators with the required fluidic-capacitance for the intended system is thus presented.},

The dimensions of the flap are determined through frequency domain analysis under different sea states and the required discharge of desalinated water. Further, the whole system, including the reverse osmosis (RO) module, is modeled using WEC-Sim (an open-source code) and Simscape/SimHydraulics toolbox in MATLAB. The analysis of the system under six different sea states shows encouraging results for freshwater production. Considering the sea states studied here, the designed system can generate more than 50 bar pressure of the seawater feed discharge and produce up to 100 L/h of freshwater with TDS less than 500 mg/L.

abstract   = {Wave energy is a significant source of renewable energy harnessed by wave energy converters (WECs). However, due to the relatively high levelised cost of energy (LCoE), wave energy has not attained a commercial stage yet. To minimise the LCoE, since the optimum (uncontrolled) WEC design typically differs from the optimum controlled WEC design, control co-design (CCD) techniques are essential. With CCD, the WEC control-related aspects are taken into account from the start of the WEC design phase and, ideally, the best control-informed WEC design is then achieved. This paper specifically focuses on CCD for an oscillating-watercolumn (OWC) WEC, equipped with a Wells turbine and a bypass valve. In essence, a parametric CCD approach is devised to find the optimum (control-informed) turbine rotor diameter, and bypass valve diameter, for the considered OWC WEC. In particular, the optimum design parameters minimise a 'simplified' LCoE, which is chosen as a suitable performance function. Despite the LCoE is primarily sensitive to the power takeoff size, rather than to the bypass valve size, peak-shaving control with a bypass valve potentially increases the capacity factor and, consequently, can minimise the LCoE for small-to-medium sized turbines.},

These coefficients become matrices for a system of interacting wave-generating oscillators. A derivation and an optimization of the power absorbed by the system are obtained by using a phenomenological theory. Subsequently the phenomenological parameters are related with hydrodynamics. Finally the optimum absorption by two heaving point oscillators is considered. It is demonstrated that the optimum velocity for maximum power absorption is not in all cases in phase with the excitation force.},

abstract   = {In the reverse osmosis (RO) desalination process, a salt water solution is pressurized to overcome the osmotic pressure across a semi-permeable membrane. A few groups have proposed that a wave energy converter (WEC) having a seawater based, hydraulic power takeoff can could be used to pressurize the feedwater for an RO system. However, coupling the wave energy harvesting process and the RO desalination process imposes unique design constraints on the fluid power system, such as pressure limits of conventional RO system components. In this study, a fluid power circuit with a switch-mode power transformer is used to transfer power while keeping the pressure of the power takeoff and RO processes relatively decoupled. The switch-mode power transformer studied herein adds fewer costly components and less significant loss mechanisms to the system than a conventional hydraulic transformer performing the same function. The switch-mode power transformer uses the inertia of a hydraulic motor driven electric generator and switching of the hydraulic motor inlet between high and lowpressure sources to decrease the pressure at which power is being transmitted to the RO process. This process is analogous to DC-DC switching power transformers in the electrical domain. This study seeks to demonstrate this unique switch-mode system as a potential solution for coupling the wave-energy harvesting process with the reverse osmosis process. The system is modeled and studied in the context that the transformer and RO system are onshore, 500 meters from the WEC. Power captured from the WEC is transmitted through a long pipeline to shore. A distributed parameter model is used to model the pipeline dynamics, simultaneously revealing the significance of these dynamics and the robustness with which the switch-mode transformer decouples the pressure dynamics at the RO feed from the pipeline dynamics. The switch-mode power transformer is estimated to be 76% efficient while the system, as a whole, is estimated to be 45% efficient.},

In this paper a reverse osmosis water desalination unit having a small spiral-wound membrane was operated in a cyclic mode so as to reduce the effect of concentration polarization. Asymmetric square wave pressure pulses were employed in which the average pressure was always kept at a value of 25 bars. The effects of the time split (the duration of the higher operating pressure divided by the total period of the forcing wave) on the performance of the system was investigated. For the cases considered, cyclic operation lead to an increase in the permeate flux of about 6.5% over that obtained from steady-state operation. The maximum permeation rate was obtained at a time split T-0.6. As for the product quality, the concentration of the salt was not affected by the periodic mode of operation.},

This report documents the material gathered during a year-long fact-finding effort engaging users and developers, through literature review, workshops, interviews, and national lab analyses, as well as a Request for Information process. Each market was assessed by a set of common analyses: opportunity summary; application description and power requirements; market description, power options, and geographic relevance; marine energy potential value proposition; and path forward including research and development needs and potential partners. The major finding is that there are more markets with potential than anticipated, both for Power at Sea (including ocean observation and navigation, underwater vehicle charging, marine aquaculture, marine algae, and seawater mining), and Resilient Coastal Communities (including desalination, coastal resiliency and disaster recovery, and community-scale isolated power systems). The enabling attributes of marine energy resources include that they are abundant, geographically diverse, energy dense, predictable, and complementary to other energy sources. This report can help direct analysis and research and development efforts by government, scientists, developers, and other stakeholders to more deeply understand and meet specific technical and economic requirements to power emerging opportunities in the blue economy.},

The efficiency of humidity swing driven air capture under humid and windy conditions is tested in the laboratory. Powered by wind, we estimate ∼75 Mt CO 2 /yr could be collected using air capture and sequestered below seafloor or partially used for synfuel. Our analysis suggests that Kerguelen offers a remote and environmentally secure location for CO 2 sequestration using renewable energy. Regional reservoirs could hold over 1500 Gt CO 2 , sequestering a large fraction of 21st century emissions.},

abstract     = {Wave energy converters (WECs) can advance the global energy transition by producing clean power for utility grids and offshore technologies. This paper provides a multidisciplinary, dual objective optimization of the Reference Model 3 (RM3), a two-body point absorber WEC design benchmark. The simulation model employs linear hydrodynamics with force saturation and probabilistic waves. The RM3 geometry and controller parameters are optimized using sequential quadratic programming to minimize the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the coefficient of variation of power. The minimum-LCOE design produces a power variation of 205% and an LCOE of $0.08/kWh, a seven-fold cost reduction and 23% lower variation from the RM3 baseline of $0.75/kWh and 255% variation. Parameter sensitivities show that LCOE depends more strongly on site and economic parameters than geometric or material parameters, while power variation is largely insensitive to all parameters. A Pareto tradeoff between cost and power variation reveals different optimal designs depending on which objective is prioritized, suggesting application-specific design heuristics. Three representative optimal designs are investigated: a minimum-LCOE design for costsensitive operations like utility power, a minimum-variation design for cost-insensitive installations like small offshore systems, and a balanced design for intermediate applications. Power probability distributions are shown for each.},

However, the energy required to run desalination plants remains a drawback. The idea of using renewable energy sources is fundamentally attractive and many studies have been done in this area, mostly relating to solar or wind energy. In contrast, this study focuses on the potential to link ocean-wave energy to desalination. The extent of the resource is assessed, with an emphasis on the scenario of wave energy being massively exploited to supply irrigation in arid regions. Technologies of wave-powered desalination are reviewed and it is concluded that relatively little work has been done in this area. Along arid, sunny coastlines, an efficient wave-powered desalination plant could provide water to irrigate a strip of land 0.8 km wide if the waves are 1 m high, increasing to 5 km with waves 2 m high. Wave energy availabilities are compared to water shortages for a number of arid nations for which statistics are available. It is concluded that the maximum potential to correct these shortages varies from 16% for Morocco to 100% for Somalia and many islands. However, wave energy is mainly out-of-phase with evapotranspiration demand leading to capacity ratios of 3-9, representing the ratios of land areas that could be irrigated with and without seasonal storage. In the absence of storage, a device intended for widespread application should be optimised for summer wave heights of about 1 m. If storage is available, it should be optimised for winter wave heights of 2-2.5 m.},

  abstract = {This report is an addendum to SAND2013-9040: Methodology for Design and Economic Analysis of Marine Energy Conversion (MEC) Technologies. This report describes an Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Converter (OSWEC) reference model design in a complementary manner to Reference Models 1â•ﬁ4 contained in the above report. A conceptual design for a taut moored oscillating surge wave energy converter was developed. The design had an annual electrical power of 108 kilowatts (kW), rated power of 360 kW, and intended deployment at water depths between 50 m and 100 m. The study includes structural analysis, power output estimation, a hydraulic power conversion chain system, and mooring designs. The results were used to estimate device capital cost and annual operation and maintenance costs. The device performance and costs were used for the economic analysis, following the methodology presented in SAND2013-9040 that included costs for designing, manufacturing, deploying, and operating commercial-scale MEC arrays up to 100 devices. The levelized cost of energy estimated for the Reference Model 5 OSWEC, presented in this report, was for a single device and arrays of 10, 50, and 100 units, and it enabled the economic analysis to account for cost reductions associated with economies of scale. The baseline commercial levelized cost of energy estimate for the Reference Model 5 device in an array comprised of 10 units is $1.44/kilowatt-hour (kWh), and the value drops to approximately $0.69/kWh for an array of 100 units.},
